# TryHackMe – SOC Level 1 & Network Analysis Labs

## Overview
This folder documents my ongoing practical training on **TryHackMe**, primarily focused on the **SOC Level 1 path** and supporting modules in **Network Analysis**, **Threat Detection**, and **Incident Response**.  
This learning journey provides hands-on experience with tools and techniques used by real-world Security Operations Centers.

**Progress:** 36% (SOC Level 1)
