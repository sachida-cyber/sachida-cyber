# Log Analysis and Event Investigation

## Overview
This section focuses on **log analysis and event investigation**, which are critical components of Security Operations Center (SOC) work.  
It demonstrates my understanding of how to collect, parse, and analyze logs from various sources to detect anomalies, correlate alerts, and identify potential security incidents.

This repository includes practical examples of **SIEM investigations, correlation queries, event parsing, and log enrichment** using tools like **IBM QRadar, Splunk, and ELK Stack**.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and analyze system, network, and application logs.  
- Create detection rules and correlation searches.  
- Investigate suspicious activities using real-world log data.  
- Demonstrate incident triage and evidence collection.

## Tools and Technologies
| Tool / Platform | Purpose |
|------------------|----------|
| **IBM QRadar** | Log correlation and SIEM event analysis. |
| **Splunk** | Log parsing, search queries, and alert investigation. |
| **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** | Centralized log management and visualization. |
| **Syslog / Windows Event Viewer** | Log source generation and manual inspection. |
| **Regex / AQL / KQL** | Query and rule-writing for pattern detection. |

## Demonstrated Skills
- SIEM Query Writing (AQL, SPL, KQL)  
- Log Normalization and Enrichment  
- Event Correlation and Alert Tuning  
- Suspicious Activity Detection  
- Root Cause and Timeline Analysis

## Example Work (Planned Content)
| File / Section | Description |
|----------------|--------------|
| `windows-log-analysis.md` | Investigation of Windows event logs to detect privilege escalation. |
| `firewall-logs-review.md` | Analysis of firewall traffic patterns to identify possible data exfiltration. |
| `splunk-search-lab.md` | Use of SPL queries for detecting brute-force and login anomalies. |
| `qradar-event-correlation.md` | QRadar correlation rules for detecting insider threats. |

## Learning Focus
By building this section, I aim to:
- Strengthen practical SOC log analysis capabilities.  
- Develop a reusable workflow for incident triage.  
- Showcase correlation rule engineering and alert tuning expertise.
