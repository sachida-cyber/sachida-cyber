# ⚙️ Offense Priority Matrix
**Author:** Sachida Nand Sharma  
**Purpose:** Define offense severity levels based on impact, confidence, and affected asset criticality.

| Offense Type                | Impact Level | Confidence | Asset Criticality | Final Severity | Recommended Action             |
|-----------------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Brute Force Attack          | Medium        | High        | Medium            | High           | Block source IP, force MFA reset |
| Phishing Attempt            | Medium        | Medium      | Low               | Medium         | Quarantine email, user awareness |
| DNS Exfiltration Attempt    | High          | High        | High              | Critical       | Block domain, isolate endpoint  |
| Ransomware Activity         | Critical      | Very High   | High              | Critical       | Isolate host, trigger IR plan  |
| Unauthorized SMB Connections| Medium        | Medium      | Medium            | High           | Investigate lateral movement   |

> **Formula Used:**  
> Final Severity = (Impact Weight × Confidence Weight × Asset Criticality Weight) ÷ 3  
> *(Weights: Low=1, Medium=2, High=3, Critical=4)*
